    <p>Mochi is a traditional Japanese rice cake made from glutinous rice and various flavorings</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>15 fresh whole strawberries</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup Mochiko Sweet Rice Flour</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 drops whie vinegar</li>
        <li>Red food coloring</li>
        <li>Extra mochiko flour or cornstarch for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        <li>Wash and rinse strawberries. Remove the green leaves. Dry the strawberries thoroughly before placing them in the mochi.</li>
        <li>Clean your counter and sprinkle it with Mochiko flour or cornstarch. I place parchment paper down and then cover it with cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Measure out the Mochiko flour and sugar and mix in a medium size bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the water, vinegar, and food coloring to the rice flour. Mix thoroughly with a whisk.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a microwaveable plate or wrap.</li>
        <li>Place the mochi mixture in the microwave and cook on a high setting for a minute. Not all microwaves have the same strength, so your cook time might be less or more. Please adjust accordingly. I have a powerful microwave.</li>
        <li>After a minute of cooking, take it out of the oven and stir. Cover again with plastic and cook another minute. Repeat this until you cook it for about 4 minutes, and make sure to stir the mochi each time.</li>
        <li>On your prepped countertop, form dough into a small pancake about 3 1/2 - 4 inches wide in diameter. Be careful; the dough is super hot. Also, the mochi will be sticky, so dust your hands and the mochi with cornstarch or mochiko flour.</li>
        <li>Place one strawberry in the middle of your round pancake, and place the strawberry upside down. Next, bring up the sides of the mochi and pinch the dough together. Make sure that all edges get pinched together, so there are no holes.</li>
        <li>Roll mochi in a ball in your hand. Place the seam side down on a plate sprinkled with Mochiko flour or cornstarch.</li>
