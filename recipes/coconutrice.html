    <p>Coconut rice is a staple dish in Southeast Asia, made using coconut milk and rice</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
        <li>400ml coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tbs white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees C</li>
        <li>Rinse rice in water until the water runs pretty clear.</li>
        <li>Drain rice then soak in water for 1 hour. Then drain in a colander and leave to drain well for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the rice in a 20cm / 8" square pan (metal or ceramic).</li>
        <li>Heat coconut milk, water, sugar and salt in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and stir to dissolve the sugar.</li>
        <li>Working quickly (to minimise heat loss), pour hot liquid over rice, stir quickly to spread rice evenly. Cover with foil then bake in the oven for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven. Take a quick peek to ensure the liquid has been absorbed (tilt pan to check). There will be coconut cream on the surface, that's normal. Rest rice, covered, for 15 minutes. Do not shortcut this!</li>
        <li>Fluff with rubber spatula. Garnish with toasted coconut, if using, then serve. Marvel at fluffy rice!</li>
    </ol>
